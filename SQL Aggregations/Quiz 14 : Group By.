Q1) Which account (by name) placed the earliest order? Your solution should have the account name and the date of the order.

Query :    SELECT a.id,a.name, o.occurred_at
           FROM orders o
           JOIN accounts a 
           ON a.id = o.account_id
           ORDER BY o.occurred_at
           LIMIT 1;

Output)   id	           name	                  occurred_at
          2861	         DISH Network	          2013-12-04T04:22:44.000Z
          
          

Q2) Find the total sales in usd for each account. You should include two columns - the total sales for each company's orders in usd and the company name.

Query :  SELECT a.name,  SUM(total_amt_usd) total_sales
         FROM accounts a
         JOIN orders o
         ON a.id = o.account_id
         GROUP BY a.name ;

Output :    name	        total_sales


Q3) Via what channel did the most recent (latest) web_event occur, which account was associated with this web_event? 
   Your query should return only three values - the date, channel, and account name.
   
 Query :   SELECT w.occurred_at AS date , w.channel, a.name
           FROM web_events w
           JOIN accounts a
           ON w.account_id = a.id
           GROUP BY w.occurred_at, w.channel, a.name
           ORDER BY w.occurred_at DESC
           LIMIT 1;
           
Output :   date	                         channel	     name
